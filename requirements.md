# What we're doing

Building our (possibly) first Android application. 

**Important note**

This assignment is optional, and it will not be graded. It will be a good practice to get started with Android. However, you can submit the assignment in via Canvas/Github, and you will receive a feedback within a few days.

# Why we're doing it
Getting started with a new set of tools always takes some getting used to. The best way to get familiar with a new technology and system is to dive in and make something happen. 

After this assignment, you should: 

- Be able to create and run an Android app on your machine.
- Be familiar with the basics of a single-activity Android app. 
- Be able to push your project to Github. 
- Understand how to submit your assignment correctly. 
- Be familiar with writing up a description of your app/submission. 

# How to do it

In this assignment, you are going to apply your creativity to develop your (possibly) first Android app with Android Studio. Here's a list of a few projects; choose one to build out. 

**Suggestions**
- **Tip calculator**: Your user types in how much money they spent, and they choose a percent they would like to tip. The app outputs how much money corresponds to the tip.
- **Discount calculator**: Your user types in the original price of the item, and the discount to be applied. The discount is represented as a percentage in the range 20-80%. The app outputs the two prices for the item: the original price before the discount, and the final price, after applying the discount.
- **Bill/Check-splitter**: The user inputs the total amount, how many ways to split it, and optionally the distribution (e.g. one person pays 30%, one person pays 60%, and one person pays 10%). 
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors**: The user and computer each pick an option: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer's choice is made randomly. The rules are the following: Paper beats Rock; Scissors beat Paper; and Rock beats Scissors. The app should keep track of the user player's score against the computer over time.
- **Scrabble-mini**: The computer thinks of a word, and displays the letters on the screen on a random order (but never the correct order). The user must guess the word by putting the letters in the right order.
- **Codelab Counter**: Android provides helpful codelabs to get started with Android. Going through the first 1-2 codelabs is a reasonable app for this project, or as a starting point before building one of the above apps.

# Submission
Please push your A1 to your Github Classroom repo, and create a corresponding release. Your repo must contain the following items:

- Android Studio Project folder
- Folder called "imgs" or "screenshots"
- README.md file 
   - This file should serve as a quick writeup and description of what you built. As you write this up, you should think of it in terms of showing this off as part of a programming portfolio, and the reader is a potential employer who wants to quickly understand what you did with this project. Or at the least, an easy way for me to understand, and for you to remind yourself in the future. 
   - It should be written using Github markdown (Links to an external site.)
   - It should include: 
     - Your Name
     - Short description of what you built
     - Short instructions on how to use the app 
        - We're not going to focus **too** much this quarter on user experience and such, but it will be helpful to know what to look for.
     - Screenshots of your app, which are stored in a "screenshots" or "imgs" directory 
        - See the links above about taking screenshots or videos using Android Studio
     - Summary of why you chose this project, what you learned, what you found challenging or unexpected. You might include something you didn't finish or polish or would like to do different in the future. 

Submit a link to your Github Classroom repo on Canvas.
