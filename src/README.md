# A1: Hello Android (Jeremy Cao)

## Overview

I built a tip calculator! Yea!

## Using the app 

User can enter an amount of cost of service, then user is prompted to select a tip percentage
from a list of 20%, 18%, 15%. Then once the user click CALCULATE button, the tips amount will be calculated and displayed. User can also turn on the 
option of Round up the tip.

## Walkthrough

Include some screenshots and information. Put the screenshots in the [imgs](imgs) directory, and include them in this readme like this: 

![Sample Screenshot](imgs/myfirstapp.png?raw=tru)

Or use html to resize it: 

<img src="imgs/myfirstapp.png" width="50">

## Reflection/Summary

From this project, I learned how to create a project in Android studio, how to write a xml file to design and customize the layout of my app activity, how to use binding feature instead of findIdByView, how to write kotlin functions in main activity. In the future, I would try to implement the recycle view and icons image.
