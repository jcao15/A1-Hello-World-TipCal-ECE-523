# A1: Hello Android (Jeremy Cao)

## Overview

I built a tip calculator! Yea!

## Using the app 

Tell me anything I need to know about running the app. User can enter an amount of cost of service, then user is prompted to select a tip percentage
from a list of 20%, 18%, 15%. Then once the user click CALCULATE button, the tips amount will be calculated and displayed. User can also turn on the 
option of Round up the tip.

## Walkthrough

Include some screenshots and information. Put the screenshots in the [imgs](imgs) directory, and include them in this readme like this: 

![Sample Screenshot](imgs/myfirstapp.png?raw=tru)

Or use html to resize it: 

<img src="imgs/myfirstapp.png" width="50">
